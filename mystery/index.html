    <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Mysterious Case of the Missing Ephod Stones</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">March 29, 5:30 PM</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">(Bangor Stake Center)</h2>

    <p>It is March, 1947. The town is abuzz with excitement as three local heros Peterson, Kilgour and DeGrasse have recently returned from their expedition to the middle east, and a grand "Welcome Home" party is planned for March 29th.</p>

    <p>The trio are amateur archeologists, as well as prominent members of the community in their other capacities: a lawyer, a businessman, and a doctor, respectively. They have deep ties to local and state dignitaries, who are expected to attend the party at 5:30 PM at the community even hall on Grandview Avenue.</p>

    <p>A few members of the community, including a newspaper reporter for the Pine Ridge Gazette, have been lucky enough to get a private viewing of the treasures that were brought back from the expedition. The reported artifacts include: a sarcophagus, various small statues and vases, ancient scrolls, and the item they seemed most proud of: and ancient Israelite Ephod with all twelve of its gemstones still intact. Many of these artifacts were seen and photographed by those received the tour, but others, such as the sarcophagus are yet to be seen - as they were still in their shipping crates.</p>

    <p>The friends, Peterson, Kilgour and DeGrasse are also the founding members of the Pine Ridge Rod and Rifle club - a hunting and fishing club that has grown to 15 total members who make active use of their lake-side club lodge just a few miles out of town.</p>
