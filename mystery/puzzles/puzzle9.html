    <h2>Puzzle Goal: Decode the Codex, Reveal the Hidden Message</h2> 

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Someone has been working on decyphering an ancient message - maybe you can do it?</li>
      <li>You MAY write on the paper as you work on solving it (the paper will be replaced for the next group)</li>
      <li>There are a lot of other ancient papers here ... perhaps they have hints.</li>
      <li>Once you have solved the codex, you have also earned the right to open the gift box - please keep track of what comes out of it: it all has to go back in for the next group.</li>
      <li>Don't forget to look around the room for other evidence</li>
    </ul>

    <br/>
    
    <h2>After You Have Solved the Puzzle - Before Leaving the Room -</h2>

    <p>After you have investigated the contents of the containers and cryptix and gift box and recorded your findings in your notebook, please:</p>
    <uL>
      <li>Make note of (or photograph) the message, then fold up the message and have someone take it in their pocket, so that it is not in the room for the next group.</li>
      <li>Take another copy of the unsolved codex out of the yellow envelope and place it on the center of the table for the next group.</li>
      <li>Put the other ancient papers back (roughly) as you found them - scattered randomly about the table.</li>
      <li>Please close up the gift box, making sure the rhinestones, gem and pieces of paper are back in it.</li>
      <li>Please leave the room tidy, and as you found it</li>
      <li>Do not remove clues, decorations, evidence, etc.!  Make notes of it or take pictures of it instead - except in the case of this puzzle, please do remove the solved codex paper by folding it and putting it in someone's pocket.</li>
    </uL>
