    <h2>Puzzle Goal: Open The Locked Box</h2>

    <h3>Hints:</h3>
    <p>An Ephod was part of the dress of the high priest that we first read about in the Book of Exodous.  The Ephod was shaped like a waistcoat with two shoulder pieces and a girdle. It was of richly variegated material, blue, purple, and scarlet. On the shoulder pieces were two onyx stones on which were engraved the names of the 12 tribes. To the ephod was fastened the Breastplate of Judgment.</p>
    
    <p>The names of the 12 tribes engraved upon the onyx stones were a memorial to those tribes.  Where do we read about this ephod onyx memorial?</p>
