    <h2>Puzzle Goal: Hit the Correct Musical Notes</h2>

    <h3>Hints:</h3>

    <p>To see you through one must do more than wish upon a star.</p>

    <p>The Guardian's ear must hear the notes that ring true.</p>

    <p>Remember, you have 8 minutes to work with.</p>
    
    <p>After you've played the right notes, you've earned the rights to open the gift box and see what's inside.</p>

    <h2>After You Have Solved the Puzzle - Before Leaving the Room -</h2>

      <li>Please leave the room tidy, and as you found it</li>
      <li>Do not remove clues, decorations, evidence, etc.!  Make notes of it or take pictures of it instead.</li>
