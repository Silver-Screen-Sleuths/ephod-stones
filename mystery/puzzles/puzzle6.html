    <h2>Puzzle Goal: Open The Cryptix</h2> 

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Arrange the dials on the Cryptix such that it can be opened.</li>
      <li>There are 7 dials, each having 8 possible settings. That means there are 2,097,152 possible combinations.</li>
      <li>Your hands are probably not fast enough to try all possibilities!</li>
      <li>Notice that there are a few other containers here - could they be useful?  Maybe they are easier to open.</li>
      <li>Please pay attention to time and begin exiting the room within 8 minutes of entering</li>
      <li>Once you have opened the cryptix, you have also earned the right to open the gift box.</li>
      <li>Don't forget to look around the room for other evidence</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>After You Have Solved the Puzzle - Before Leaving the Room -</h2>

    <p>After you have investigated the contents of the containers and cryptix and gift box and recorded your findings in your notebook, please:</p>
    <uL>
      <li>Place the scroll back into the cryptix, close it and scramble the dials</li>
      <li>Place the code hints back into the containers, and close them (reverse-solve the puzzles - which is much easier if you watch the path).</li>
      <li>Please leave the room tidy, and as you found it</li>
      <li>Do not remove clues, decorations, evidence, etc.!  Make notes of it or take pictures of it instead.</li>
    </uL>
