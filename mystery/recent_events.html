    <h2>Recent Events - A Mystery On Our Hands!</h2>

    
    <p>The day of Welcome Home party approaches - with dignitaries, business leaders, and state officials plan to attend, eager to honor the trioâ€™s daring feat.</p>

    <p>Today, news has spread that the gemstones from the ancient Ephod (our three heros discovered/plundered) and a sarchophagus were found to be missing. Rumors also spread across town of late evening and early morning visits and phone calls between known members of the Pine Ridge Rod and Rifle club and other mysterious goings-on.</p>

    <p>You've heard that the police have been at the temporary storage site of the artifacts - Mr. Peterson's barn - investigating the crime.</p>

    <p>As you and your friends make plans to attend the party, you can't help but feel a nagging curiosity about the missing gemstones - who has taken them, who were the accomplices and why were the stones stolen? Was it an opportunist thief? Was it an "inside job"? Your friends want to use the opportunity of being at the party - with so many community members present (and away from their homes and offices) - to do some sleuthing.</p>

    <p>In the meantime, your good friend Mark, who's always a snoop, has brought the following items to your attention.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="newspaper.html">Pine Ridge Gazette newspaper article that might be relevant</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="letter.html">Letter found dropped outside post office</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Mark also prepared this summary of well-known facts related to the case:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Since the return of the explorers a few weeks ago, the artifacts have been temporarily stored in Peterson's barn.  The intention is to have them shipped to various museums (including the Smithsonian) next week.</li>
      <li>The gemstones from the ephod breastplate and one sarcophagus were found missing three days ago.</li>
      <li>A police investigation has been conducted at the barn, and the crime is still under investigation.</li>
      <li>Various community members have been sharing rumors of late evening visits between various members of the Pine Ridge Rod and Rifle club.</li>
    </ul>
