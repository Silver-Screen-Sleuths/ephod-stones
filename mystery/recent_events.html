    <h2>Recent Events - A Mystery On Our Hands!</h2>

    
    <p>The day of Welcome Home party approaches - with dignitaries, business leaders, and state officials plan to attend, eager to honor the trioâ€™s daring feat.</p>

    <p>Today, news has spread that the gemstones from the ancient Ephod (our three heros discovered/plundered) were found to be missing. Rumors also spread across town of late evening and early morning visits and phone calls between known members of the Pine Ridge Rod and Rifle club and other mysterious goings-on.</p>

    <p>As you and your friends make plans to attend the party, you can't help but feel a nagging curiosity about the missing gemstones - who has taken them, who were the accomplices and why were the stones stolen? Was it an opportunist thief? Was it an "inside job"? Your friends want to use the opportunity of being at the party - with so many community members present (and away from their homes and offices) - to do some sleuthing.</p>
